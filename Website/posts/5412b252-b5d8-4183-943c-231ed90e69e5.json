{"ID":"5412b252-b5d8-4183-943c-231ed90e69e5","Title":"Web Developer Checklist","Author":"demo","Slug":"web-developer-checklist","Content":"<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://sedodream.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sayed</a> and I released <a href=\"http://webdevchecklist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Developer Checklist</a> to help web developer adhere to best practices. Checklists like these can be really helpful to make sure we don’t forget anything before releasing new or updated websites. </p> <p><img width=\"279\" height=\"580\" title=\"image\" style=\"padding-left: 10px; float: right;\" alt=\"image\" src=\"/posts/files/image.png\" />Now we’re introducing Web Developer Checklist as a <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer-checklist/iahamcpedabephpcgkeikbclmaljebjp\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome extension</a> that can automate a big portion of the checklist. The extension let’s you run checks for various best practices on any website - including your own running from localhost.</p> <p>It performs a series of checks by analyzing the DOM as well as integrating with 3<sup>rd</sup>-party services like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/\" target=\"_blank\">Google PageSpeed</a>.</p> <h2>Next steps</h2> <p>This first version of the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer-checklist/iahamcpedabephpcgkeikbclmaljebjp\" target=\"_blank\">Web Developer Checklist Chrome extension</a> does a series of really valuable checks. The next releases will have even more.</p> <p>Specifically, we’re looking at adding:</p> <ul> <li>HTML validation </li><li>CSS validation </li><li>Accessibility validation </li><li>JSHint </li><li>CssLint </li><li>Guidance for each item</li></ul> <p>We think these checks would be hugely beneficial. If you have ideas for other checks that can be automated, please let us know in the comments below.</p> <h2>Open source</h2> <p>The Web Developer Checklist Chrome extension is open source and hosted on our <a href=\"https://github.com/ligershark/BestPracticesChromeExtension\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub org</a>. As always, pull requests are more than welcome.</p>","PubDate":"2014-04-17T19:11:45.7822493Z","LastModified":"2014-04-17T19:15:43.4050859Z","IsPublished":true,"Categories":["Chrome"," Best Practices"],"Comments":[{"ID":"c438eb0a-fdbe-47af-b525-33ca07b3f775","Author":"Jason","Email":"jason.irwin@hotmail.com","Website":"","Content":"Very useful extension. In the few minutes I&#39;ve played with it so far I&#39;ve found a few items that can be improved on my site. I&#39;d love to see some guidance baked into the tool.
