  <content>&lt;p&gt;With every new SQL version, it seems there are more and more headaches getting it installed, unless you're installing it on a clean OS install. I ran into error after error trying to install on a Vista box that had been upgraded to Windows 7 and had SQL 2005 already installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally dug up a blog entry that helped me out on Mark Michaelis's blog. It took a bit of digging, so I figured I'd give him a bit of google juice: &lt;a href="http://mark.michaelis.net/Blog/SQLServer2008InstallNightmare.aspx"&gt;SQL 2008 install registry issues and uninstall rollback techniques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
