### Why another blog engine?
7 years have passed since I started the [BlogEngine.NET](http://dotnetblogengine.net) project. 
It was using cutting edge technology for its time and quickly became the 
most popular blogging platform using ASP.NET.

The MiniBlog was born as a test to see what a modern blog engine could
look like today with the latest ASP.NET and HTML 5 technologies. Just like
with BlogEngine.NET, the goal was to see how small and simple such a 
blog engine could be. 

This is the result.

### Connecting with Windows Live Writer (WLW)

To connect to MiniBlog with Windows Live Writer (as of WLW build 14.0.8117.416):

- Launch Windows Live Writer

- If you have not used Windows Live Writer to connect to a blog you will get a dialog window asking you to specify what blog service you use. If you have already connected Windows Live Writer to a blog, you can go to _Blogs -> Add blog account..._ and get to the same dialog window.

- In the __What blog service do you use?__ dialog window you will tick the _Other blog service_ radio option and click next.

- The __Add a blog account__ dialog window will ask you for the web address of your blog, the username and password. The web address is the root address of your site. For example, use http://miniblog.azurewebsites.net/ for the live demo site.

- The __Select blog type__ dialog window will let you know Windows Live Writer was not able to detect your blog type. It will ask you for the type of blog and the remote posting URL.  
Type of blog that you are using: _Metaweblog API_  
Remote posting URL for your blog: _http://&lt;root-address&gt;/metaweblog_  
Click next.

- The __Your blog has been set up__ dialog window will let you give your blog a nickname for the Windows Live Writer instance. Change that if you want and click finish to get to posting!

Windows Live Writer can be downloaded at:

### Configuring MiniBlog as Virtual Application

Mini blog is very compact and can be configured as a Virtual Application so you'd be able to use it alongside your existing websites. 
For example if you've got a running ASP.NET website at `http://yourexamplesite.com/` and you want to setup a blog under `/blog/` path, you could setup `http://yourexamplesite.com/blog/` with a few simple tweaks in web.config settings:

- Set `blog:path` element of `appSettings` to the virtual path that you've configured for MiniBlog. Example with path `blog`

```xml
<add key="blog:path" value="blog"/>
```

- Update the `path` attribute of all the `<handlers>` in web.config. Example with path `blog`

```xml
<handlers>
    <remove name="CommentHandler"/>
    <add name="CommentHandler" verb="*" type="CommentHandler" path="/blog/comment.ashx"/>
    <remove name="PostHandler"/>
    <add name="PostHandler" verb="POST" type="PostHandler" path="/blog/post.ashx"/>
    <remove name="MetaWebLogHandler"/>
    <add name="MetaWebLogHandler" verb="POST,GET" type="MetaWeblogHandler" path="/blog/metaweblog"/>
    <remove name="FeedHandler"/>
    <add name="FeedHandler" verb="GET" type="FeedHandler" path="/blog/feed/*"/>
    <remove name="CssHandler"/>
    <add name="CssHandler" verb="GET" type="MinifyHandler" path="/blog*.css"/>
    <remove name="JsHandler"/>
    <add name="JsHandler" verb="GET" type="MinifyHandler" path="/blog*.js"/>
</handlers>

<httpErrors>
    <remove statusCode="404"/>
    <error statusCode="404" responseMode="ExecuteURL" path="/blog/404.cshtml"/>
</httpErrors>
```

After changing the config all that is left is configuring a Virtual Application with the same path(ex. `blog`) inside your IIS website.
